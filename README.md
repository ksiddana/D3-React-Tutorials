# Car Wash Application

Provide a UI implementation to the following requirement:

* Implement a car repair shop that has a car wash, smog check, more in depth car repair services. A new customer can drive their car to one of the labelled service areas (car wash, smog, repair)
* each service area has a line (or a queue), and there is one general queue before the service areas (imagine a car coming in to the shop from the street, then gets into one of the queues for a specific service.) When a service queue fills up, new cars have to queue up on the general queue.
* If a car coming in can either be in a queue for a service area, or in a general queue leading to the service areas
* you can use a button to create an incoming car
